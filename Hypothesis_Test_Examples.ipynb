Because you don't have the original data, you cannot do a permutation test, and you cannot assess the hypothesis that the forces from Frog B and Frog C come from the same distribution.

You first translate all of the data of Frog B such that the mean is 0.55 N. This involves adding the mean force of Frog C and subtracting the mean force of Frog B from each measurement of Frog B.
